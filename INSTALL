## CScapeSomatic data files

In order to take full advantage of the Moonlight2R package, the user is advised
to download CScapeSomatic precomputed scores. Please download the following
files in the same directory on your system. For instance, on Linux/UNIX based
systems:

```
curl http://cscape-somatic.biocompute.org.uk/css_coding.vcf.gz -o css_coding.vcf.gz
curl http://cscape-somatic.biocompute.org.uk/css_coding.vcf.gz.tbi -o css_coding.vcf.gz.tbi
curl http://cscape-somatic.biocompute.org.uk/css_noncoding.vcf.gz -o css_noncoding.vcf.gz
curl http://cscape-somatic.biocompute.org.uk/css_noncoding.vcf.gz.tbi -o css_noncoding.vcf.gz.tbi
```

More information on CSCapeSomatic are available on their official webpage:

We use CScapeSomatic files as input of our `DMA()` function in Moonlight2R.
