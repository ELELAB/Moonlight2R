}
\arguments{
\item{MafFile}{Path to MAF.csv. 
The MAF file must at least contain the following columns
\itemize{
\item Empty column-name, containing row numbers
\item Hugo_Symbol eg. BRCA1
\item Chromosome eg. chr1
\item Start_Position eg. 54402
\item End_Position e.g. 54443
\item Strand eg. +
\item Variant_Classification
\item Variant_Class
\item Reference_Allele
\item Tumor_Seq_Allele1
\item Tumor_Seq_Allele2
}}

\item{DEGs}{DEGsmatrix output from DEA such as dataDEGs.}

\item{dataPRA}{Output PRA function.}

\item{runCscape}{Bolean. If \code{FALSE} will load CScape output file from results-folder
Default = \code{TRUE}.}

\item{coding_file}{A character string. Path to and name of CScape-somatic coding file.
Can be downloaded at \url{http://cscape-somatic.biocompute.org.uk/#download}. The .tbi file must be placed in the same folder.}

\item{noncoding_file}{A charcter string. Path to and name of CScape-somatic noncoding file.
Can be downloaded at \url{http://cscape-somatic.biocompute.org.uk/#download}. The .tbi file must be placed in the same folder.}

\item{results_folder}{A character string. Path to the results generated by this function.}
}
\value{
List of two, containing TSGs and OCGs with at least one driver mutation. Additionally files and plots are saved in \code{results_folder}.
}
\description{
This function carries out the driver mutation analysis
